Static site generator for Bear Notes.

## Overview

**BearPublish** transforms a Bear Notes database into a static website.

## Project Architecture

### Modules

- `BearDatabase`: SQL logic to extract notes, metadata, tags, and files.
- `BearMarkdown`: Note content markdown parser with custom bear specific processors (file blocks, wikilinks, hex colors, etc...)
- `BearWebUI`: Web UI interface made with [Plot](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Plot).
- `BearDomain`: Intermediary domain objects that mediate between database and ui layers.

### Site Generation

- `BearSiteBuilder`: Builds `BearSite` with the needed data.
- `BearSiteRenderer`: Renders a `BearSite` with the provided renderers.
- `BearSiteGenerator`: Writes rendered site to output url and copies media files.
- `BearPublisher`: Composes the generator with the data providers and needed renderers. 
- `BearPublisherComposer`: Composes the publisher with data coming from the bear database and ui renders.
- `BearPublisherCLI`: command-line interface using `ArgumentParser`.

## Installation & Usage

Build and run the CLI. By default it outputs the site into a `dist` folder:

```
swift build -c release \
swift run
```

For custom output and paths, pass arguments:

```bash
swift build -c release
.build/release/BearPublishCLI \
  --db-path /path/to/database.sqlite \
  --files-folder-path /path/to/files \
  --images-folder-path /path/to/images \
  --output ./dist \
  --title "My Static Site" \
  --lang "en""
```

## What I'd Do Differently (and Hope to Add Eventually)

- **Drop HTMX for vanilla JS** ‚Äì HTMX helped speed up the prototype, but it's overkill for what this project needs. I‚Äôm mainly using `hx-get` and `hx-swap`, and the extra attributes feel like baggage.
  
- **Better routing** ‚Äì Currently routes rely on query parameters (e.g., `?slug=note-slug`). I‚Äôd prefer cleaner URLs like `bearsit.es/note-slug`.

## Ideas for Future Improvements

- **Theme selection** ‚Äì Right now, the only supported theme is Duotone Light (‚ù§Ô∏è). I‚Äôd like to support theme selection via CLI:  
  `BearPublishCLI (...args...) --theme duotone-light`
- **Frontend theme switcher** ‚Äì Ideally, visitors should be able to select themes from the generated site's UI.
- **Fix UI bug** ‚Äì There's a minor issue when selecting nested menu items that aren‚Äôt expanded yet.
- **Mac App** ‚Äì I‚Äôd love to build a GUI for non-technical users to publish directly.
- **Tag-based note export** ‚Äì Add support for filtering exported notes via tags:  
  `BearPublishCLI --tags [dev, code, articles]`
- **Companion app** ‚Äì A lightweight CLI or GUI focused solely on exporting notes by tag in raw markdown.
- **Optimize CSS and JS** ‚Äì These were initially written in 2023 to get a quick prototype running, so some parts may be ~~ugly~~~ repetitive or unoptimized.
- **Polish frontend and markdown parser** ‚Äì Still have a lot of rough edges.

## Contributing

This is a personal open source project.  While I‚Äôd love to keep improving it, I can‚Äôt promise active maintenance or support for feature requests. That said, improvements may happen as time and energy allow.

Feel free to open issues or pull requests ‚Äî just know that response times may vary (and sometimes take a while).
